## Security Policy
Werbly is developed/supported on MacOS (both Silicon & Intel), and offers only theoretical Linux support.

#### Supported Versions
Similar to Homebrew, Werbly is rolling release: Only the current release is actively supported (subject to exception at my discretion; open an issue for any such requests).

#### Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a vulnerability, please email me at `retry-atom-afar@duck.com` using the subject 'Vulnerability Report'.
You can expect to get an update on the matter at any point within a business week.
