werb { abort | help | [un]install | [un]define <formula> | [un]apply <app> | [de]init | show | man | exit }:

    abort:
        Undefines `werb`.

    help:
        Show this message.

    [un]install:
        Either installs or uninstalls homebrew into/from an isolated directory.

    [un]define <formula>:
        Either defines or undefines a command from homebrew as <formula>.

    [un]apply <app>:
        Either applies or unapplies an application from homebrew as <app> (as shown with `werb show`).

    [de]init:
        Either initializes or deinitializes the shell environment as nessesary to contain homebrew while using it.

    show:
        Shows contents of the sandbox directory. This can be used to know what to input into `werb [un]apply`.

    man:
        Opens a pager on brew's manual as raw text. Note that the manpage is formated in markdown, and may appear odd when viewed this way.

    exit:
        undefines werb and unsets any related environmental commands/variables, including `brew`. Note this does not undefine any formulae set using `werb define`.

    perm-define-all:
        permanently defines brew and all installed formulae by modifing the current user's PATH by editing the `~/.profile` file.
