        show this message

    [un]install:
        Either installs or uninstalls homebrew into/from an isolated directory.

    [un]apply <cask>:
        Either applies or unapplies an application from homebrew as <cask> (as shown with `werb show`).
    
    [de]init:
        Either initializes or deinitializes the shell environment as nessesary to contain homebrew while using it.
    
    show:
        Shows contents of the sandbox directory. This can be used to know what to input into `werb [un]apply`.

    get <directory>:
        Fetches a previous version of werbly's sandbox contents. <directory> should be the directory to the old werbly's main folder.

    man:
        Opens a pager on brew's manual as raw text. Note that the manpage is formated in markdown, and may appear odd when viewed this way.
