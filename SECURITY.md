# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Similar to Homebrew, Werbly is rolling release. That means only the current release is suported. However, this is subject to exception at my discretion.
Werbly is only suported on MacOS.


## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open a private issue on the matter.

You can privately open an issue at <https://github.com/atlairovikin/werbly/issues>.
You can expect to get an update on the matter at any point within a buisness week.
