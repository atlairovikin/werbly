# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Similar to Homebrew, Werbly is rolling release. That means only the current release is supported. However, this is subject to exception at my discretion.
Werbly is only supported on MacOS (silicon & intel chip).


## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, please open an (ideally private) issue on the matter.

You can open an issue at <https://github.com/atlairovikin/werbly/issues>.
You can expect to get an update on the matter at any point within a business week.
