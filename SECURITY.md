# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

#"Use this section to tell people about which versions of your project are currently being supported with security updates.":
I advise to use with discression; do not blindly lean upon it.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| N/A.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < x-a   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

#"Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.":
Please report a vulnerability using the 'issues' tab on the github page at "insert-url-here".

#"Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or declined, etc.":
There are likely going to be vulnerabilities as a baseline; We're dealing with Homebrew.
Dispite this, I will do what I can (within realistic expectations) to solve as many as I can, when I can.
That is to say: I'll get to it, but it may take a while.
